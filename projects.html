<h3>Puffweb.com</h3>
This was how I got started. I'll never forget this. I was delivering pizza in 6 feet of snow, hoping and praying for a decent tip. (Buy the way 2 dollars is NOT a good tip so keep that in mind!).

All I did was deliver pizza, come home and study Digital Marketing. One day I got the courage up to start my first blog. I saw an oppurtunity in electronic cigarettes. They were the new hot thing, and anytime something is new on the market there are always a ton of people interested in buying the best brand.

So I created this blog to review ecigs and also allowed others to post their reviews. In 14 months I went from a broke pizza boy to a $30,000 per month blogger.

The only problem was, I did not have any real interest in electronic cigarettes. Sure I knew a lot about them, but it wasn't something I wanted to do forever. So after I got disinterested in the site, I sold it for a nice profit.

<h3>Aqua Bar & Lounge</h3>
I was bored of blogging and I wanted to try my hand at the brick and mortar sector. There was this beatup old bar in town that had just been shut down. 

I bought it, remodeled it, and the plan was to make it the hottest spot in town, then sell it.

People laughed, they said it wouldn't work. They told me I knew nothing about bars, and that because it was tucked back in a plaza and not on a main road, it would fail as it always had. Every single owner of this place went out of business since the building was built in the 50's. I did it anyway. 

It's true, I knew nothing about bars. I figured that out as I went. But what I did know, was Facebook ads. I knew I could PACK that place easily, no matter what. I could know everything about bars, but if I had no customers it wouldn't do much good.

I ran an "opening night" Facebook ad campaign for 30 days prior to us opening. We had 240 customers our first night, and stayed packed and profitable from that day on. I sold it a little over a year later for a $300,000 profit. 

I did no print, tv, or newspaper advertising. This was 100% Facebook ads. You can check out some if the videos I used in my ads <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JLSWG2cf3o" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as3qbZVSG70" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3>Belwood's Irish Pub</h3>
This was a small Irish Pub I bought and flipped inside of 6 months. 

Since I was succeeding so much with Aqua, I thought I could do it again.

While I did increase business almost immediately, running 2 bars at once was way more stress than I anticipated. As well, I did not realize how awesome my landlord was at Aqua, because the one here was a nightmare.

So I let this one go early for a reasonable but "<i>lower than I would have liked</i>" price. 

Still feels good to breath new life into a failing business though! I leanred not to bite off more than I can chew with this one!

<h3>Dork Tees</h3>
This is my new startup. I took all my sick and twisted ideas and turned them into a nerdy t-shirt company.

I could have gone the easy route, but instead I invested a substantial amount into machinery and a shop, and we actually design, print, and ship all from our location in the Tampa Bay, FL area.

The profit margin is much higher, and since we primarily sell our line on amazon, we need that margin to offset the Amazon fees. 

This company has enjoyed some pretty early success. I started a Nerd Blog (as you will see below) to help promote our shirts. Our first post went viral. 500,000 Facebook shares and 2 Million views in 3 days! 

This launched us overnight from about 3 sales a week on Amazon to over 300! Content Marketing works folks!

<h3>Flick Nerd</h3>
This is a blog that covers nerd related issues. Initially my goal was to create great content and promote our T-shirts at the end of each post. This has worked amazingly well and we have also done several live talk shows on Google Hangouts and drove alot of sales that way as well.

I have also done thousands in Google AdSense, which is so nice bonus income.

I do not post on here much, only when I know it's a home run. You'll notice that most of the posts have 300 to 500 shares. This is typical, with one post going over 500,000 being a grand slam. 

I'm actually actively seeking writers for this blog, as I would like to turn it into much more of a magazine style entity, but simply don't have the time to write all the posts myself.

<h3>My Private Studio</h3>
Before I ever was an entrepreneur, I was a musician and even went to school for audio engineering.
Many young people in my position (when faced with success and money) would spend it on parties, drugs, cars, etc.

I'm not interested in those things. Well, maybe a car. I did buy a brand new Camaro which I love, but I was a cheap ass and got the 6 cylinder so I could get another guitar ha!

Instead of spending my money on stupid things, I built an entire recording studio and production facility inside my home. I took out walls, moved rooms, went all out.

Not only is this my personal playground which I enjoy every day, it allows me to quickly Produce audio and video media for all of my companies instead of having to hire out. I think it was a good investment because all my productions sound super professional and get done quickly. You can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ProMixStudios/videos/490437461091555/" target="_blank">view a studio tour here</a> if you like.

Every once in a while I will record bands and artists, not for the money (which is very little) but because I just love doing it.

If you like jazz, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DanHenry86/videos/387575881415568/" target="_blank">here's something I did for fun</a>.
