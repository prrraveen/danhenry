<h1 class="text-center text-uppercase google2">My Story</h1>


<img src="/img/dancity.png" class="pull-left img-responsive" style="max-width:300px;">
<h3 class="text-uppercase">I was delivering Pizza a year before I had my first $30,000 month</h3>


I started from scratch. I knew nothing about blogging, Facebook ads, content marketing, nada.

All I knew how to do was play guitar and deliver pizza. Deliver the pie, pray for a good tip, barely pay my bills, repeat. 

It was easy. Safe.

I knew I wanted more, but I didn't know how to get there. All I knew was that one day I wanted to make great money, and be able to do it wearing Batman underwear. Not too much to ask right? 





<h3>Let's go back to 2009</h3>

In 2009 I moved to Chicago and didn't really know what I wanted to do with my life. I delivered pizza to pay the rent, and hated every minute of it. I’m the creative type, so I always have to have an outlet for my creativity, and working for someone else generally doesn't allow for that.

I decided I wanted to start my own business and I knew the internet was the way to do it.

So I did something a little crazy, I locked myself away for 2 years and learned everything I could about Internet marketing. I read books, listened to podcasts, watched webinars, read blog posts, everything. 

<h3>My first blog hit $30,000 in 14 months</h3>

I decided to try my hand first, at affiliate marketing. My first blog grew from zero to $30,000 per month in just 14 months.

I was completely blown away that this had happened to me, and I become addicted to entrepreneurship.


<h3>So I kept going.</h3>

I sold my blog for a sweet profit, and bought a failing nightclub. I took what I learned about Internet marketing, and used it to turn the place around. No print advertising, no flyers, no coupons, just social media marketing. 

I literally used the SAME methods, the same thought process when promoting my nightclub as I did my blog and other businesses. I simply applied it to that particular business.

It ended up becoming the hottest spot in town and I flipped it a year later for $300,000 profit.

<h3>I started a brand new company I am Super excited about</h3>
I am huge huge Nerd as you may know by now, so why not embrace that?
My most recent startup is a nerdy T-shirt company called Dork Tees. When we started no one knew who we were, so I used blogging to promote the company. 

It took just one viral blog post to take us from 0 sales, to having top seller status on Amazon in less than a week. 

We’ve since grown like crazy and ship out hundreds of orders every week for our Amazon customers. All from nerdy blog posts and my Facebook techniques that built my first blog and my nightclub!


<h3>My biggest struggle</h3>

My biggest struggle has been doubt. Even though I am 30 years old, I’ve always had this baby face, and sometimes it prevents me from being taken seriously. I have constantly heard "You're just a kid" or You can't do it". I hate hearing that I can't do something. I knew that if I learned the technicals, I could do it.

I wanted to prove everyone wrong, and I wanted to do it on my own terms, wearing what I want, waking up when I want, just being me.

I’m 30 now, and since then I have . . . .

<ul>
<li>Built a $30,000 per month blog</li>
<li>Opened a successful nightclub using Facebook ads and flipped i for a 6 figure profit.</li>
<li>Consulted national chain affiliates (Sam's Club and Subway) on Digital Marketing</li>
<li>Interviewed as an Expert on Huff Post Live</li>
<li>Built a t-shirt line with thousands of Amazon Sales using viral content marketing</li>
</ul>

Even to this day, I STILL get, <strong><i>"you're just a kid”</i></strong>. 

So I know what it is like to have people doubt you. 


<h3>In 2016, now I would like to help YOU</h3>

I have struggled to get where I am... and one thing I have learned, is not to ever give up. So if you won't give up on me, then I won't give up on you...

This year I not only want to continue growing my businesses, but I want to help others grow as well. 

I'd like to show you the process I use to grow any business, whether it be a blog or a donut shop, a nightclub or a t-shirt line. I'd also like to show you how to apply it to YOUR business.

<h2 class="text-center text-uppercase">I learned Digital Marketing so I never have to wear a suit or tie</h2>


I'm addicted to growth.

I'm a college dropout that went from delivering pizza to successfully launching several business online and off. I know the guts, courage, blood, sweat and tears it takes to get where you want to be.

You don't have to be frustrated or waste time trying to figure out how to build your business with Digital  Marketing.

I spent 2 years geeking out on learning what works. I want to show you my process in a nice neat format so you don't have to spend years figuring it out on your own.

<img src="/img/jacket.png" class="center-block img-responsive" style="max-width:300px;">

I succeeded because I was hungry. I knew I could do great things, but I didn't know how. So I went and learned how. Simple. You have to be hungry for knowledge. I can't teach anyone that has no appetite for greatness.
